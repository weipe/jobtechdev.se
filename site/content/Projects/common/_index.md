The purpous for JobTech Taxonomy is to support a common language for describing labour market information.

- **Stability** -The structured standardized information changed via a committee. The most important standard is SSYK Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations.
- **Flexibility** -The skills and occupations  extracted from published job ads.

## Paradigm of the Future
We are currently developing a new uniform structure of all taxonomy data. The new structure will support both stable slow changeing standardized data like SSYK and more flexible rapidly changed data like skills and occupations.
