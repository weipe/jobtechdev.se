You can improve your job seeking service by using **JobTech search** as your search engine.
Integrating JobTech search means that you don't need to develop search technology anymore.
For the labour market, this feature brings many benefits:

<!--- JobTech search is an [open API](http://develop.sokapi.platsbanka.nu/)-->
- JobTech search is [open source](/doc/samples) and based on [elastic search](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
- All searchable job postings are [open data](/doc/api)
