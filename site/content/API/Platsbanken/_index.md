*With the API it is free of charge for everyone to interact with ArbetsfÃ¶rmedlingens job ad database with in custom built services.*

The API is an open interface without contract or registration requirements. Some of the data returned from the service is of the type of fuzzy matching.
This means that the results from a list search results in hits closely related keywords. Soft matching takes place in the professions and municipalities.

>Example of fuzzy matching:
If you are looking for a "bagare" (baker), you also get hits for "Konditor" (confectioner) because these two occupations are closely related.

See the technical description for details requests.
